Stock Analysis Agent System (Colab Notebook)
This Google Colab notebook provides a comprehensive stock analysis tool powered by AI agents, offering fundamental, technical, and sentiment analysis for stocks. Built with LangChain, it integrates with APIs for financial data, technical indicators, and market sentiment, and features a Gradio-based web interface for user interaction.
Features

Fundamental Analysis: Analyzes financial statements (income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements) using the financialdatasets.ai API.
Technical Analysis: Retrieves stock price data and calculates technical indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands) using financialdatasets.ai and pandas_ta.
Sentiment Analysis: Fetches options chain data (via yfinance), insider trading data (via financialdatasets.ai), and market news sentiment (via Tavily API).
Gradio Interface: A user-friendly web interface in Colab to input queries and view results, with processing time displayed.
Supervisor Agent: Coordinates the fundamental, technical, and sentiment agents to provide a cohesive investment recommendation (e.g., buy, hold, sell).

Getting Started
Prerequisites

A Google Colab account (free tier is sufficient).
API keys for:
Poe API (POE_API_KEY)
Financial Datasets API (FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY)
Tavily API (TAVILY_API_KEY)



Setup Instructions

Clone or Download the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

Alternatively, download stock_analysis_colab.ipynb directly from the repository.

Open in Google Colab:

Navigate to Google Colab.
Click File > Upload Notebook and select stock_analysis_colab.ipynb.


Install Dependencies:

The notebook includes a cell to install required libraries. Run the following cell in Colab:!pip install gradio==4.44.0 pandas==2.2.2 requests==2.32.3 langchain_openai==0.2.1 tavily-python==0.5.0 yfinance==0.2.43 pandas_ta==0.3.14b0




Set API Keys:

Run the cell provided in the notebook to input API keys securely using getpass:import os
from getpass import getpass
os.environ['POE_API_KEY'] = getpass('Enter your Poe API key: ')
os.environ['FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY'] = getpass('Enter your Financial Datasets API key: ')
os.environ['TAVILY_API_KEY'] = getpass('Enter your Tavily API key: ')


Note: Avoid hardcoding API keys in the notebook for security reasons.


Run the Notebook:

Execute the main script cell to launch the Gradio interface.
Colab will provide a public URL (e.g., https://*.ngrok.io) to access the interface in your browser.



Usage

Access the Gradio Interface:
